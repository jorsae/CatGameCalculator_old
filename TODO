Cat Game Event Crafting:
    Requirements:
        - Items:
            - 3 raw materials
            - 6 crafted materials
        - Input:
            - Amount of supplies and event tokens
        - Determining factor:
            - Event tokens is more restricted than supplies. At least for Sammy
            - Supplies (Cotton, Log, Quartz, etc)
            - Event tokens
        - Boosts can decrease the event token cost


Technical:
    General:
        ☐ Figure out what can be merged together among app and event
            ✔ populate floor @done(20-02-25 05:15)
            ☐ craftingItemInputted function
            ☐ addFloor function
        ✔ Make things consistent! @done(20-02-25 05:22)
            A lot of things on event uses key, while on app they use key.toLowerCase()
            Make sure stuff like this is consistent accross the files.
            i.e: craftingItemInputted is not consistent!
            Functions like craftingItemInputted should be put in a single file and then exported
        ☐ Make the user able to change the sorting method. (rarity, quantity, etc)
    User interface:
        ☐ Add a favicon for the website
        ☐ Waterstone and Elementstone overflow in the outputTable on mobile devices.
        ☐ Add display(popover?) when you click on button: "Add floor", "Copy to clipboard".
        ☐ Add cat images to the website?
        ☐ Add tooltip to show that the table have been added to the users clipboard
        ☐ Make an email address and put it in on the website (footer?)
        ☐ Display to the user that calculate is on cooldown
            Probably have it show up as a tooltip?

        Edge:

        ☐ Make both floors.js use strings in their requirement instead of CraftingRequirement objects
            This does not seem to have any noticeable effect. I took the time during window.onload. So my test was useless
        ☐ Clean up all css files for minify and bundler
        ☐ Minify css files
        ☐ After reply from Mino games regarding using their images. Make all crafting items in a spritesheet.
        ☐ General images: (Up/down arrow, info-icon) should be in a spritesheet
        ☐ Look into the "duplicate home page" message on https://search.google.com/
