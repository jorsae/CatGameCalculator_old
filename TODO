  ✔ Make things consistent! @done(20-02-25 05:22) @project(Technical.General)
    A lot of things on event uses key, while on app they use key.toLowerCase()
    Make sure stuff like this is consistent accross the files.
    i.e: craftingItemInputted is not consistent!
    Functions like craftingItemInputted should be put in a single file and then exported
  ✔ Make both floors.js use strings in their requirement instead of CraftingRequirement objects @done(20-02-25 10:46) @project(Technical.General)
    This does not seem to have any noticeable effect. I took the time during window.onload. So my test was useless
    I re-did the test and the performance improvement is significant, specially on mobile devices.
  ✔ Make clickUp/clickDown events added with jQuery, so ui.js can be minified! @done(20-02-25 05:07) @project(Technical.General)
    This will also make my current code for injecting clickUp/clickDown in event.js redundant.
    This function will have to have a rawMaterialCount so we can ignore those items!
